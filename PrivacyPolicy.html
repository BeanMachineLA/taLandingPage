        <h3>Our Privacy Commitment</h3>
        
        <p>
        Talnts, Inc. ("<b>Talnts</b>," "we," "us" or "our") is committed to respecting the privacy rights and concerns of all users of Talnts's website where this Privacy Policy is posted (the "Site") (we refer to the Site, the services and the software made available by Talnts including the mobile application (the "App"), collectively, as the "Talnts Features"). As such, we have established and implemented this Privacy Policy to inform visitors to the Site and users of the Talnts Features how we use and protect the information we collect through the Site and/or the Talnts Features. By accessing the Site or using any of the Talnts Features, you consent to Talnts's collection, use, storage, deletion and disclosure of information relating to you as set forth in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is effective as of the date set forth above and is only applicable to the Site and the Talnts Features and not to any other website or mobile application that you may be able to access from the Site or the Talnts Features which may have its own data collection and use practices and policies.
        </p>
        
        <p>This policy answers the following questions:
        </p>
        <ul><li>What information do we collect about you and how do we use it?</li>
            <li>Will we share your personal information with third parties?</li>
            <li>What choices do you have about the collection and use of your personal information?</li>
            <li>What security measures do we take to safeguard your personal information?</li></ul>
        
        <h3>Types of Information We Collect</h3>
        <p>
        Personal information means information that can be used to identify and contact you. You need to submit personal information to access the Site, the App, and the Talnts Features.  We may collect non-personal information such as your browser type, when you accessed the Site and from what physical location you accessed the Site. This information may be aggregated to measure the number of visits, average time spent, page views, and other statistics about users of the Site. We also may use this data to monitor the Site's performance and to make the Site easier and more convenient to use.
        </p>
        <p>
        To create an account for the Talnts Features, we require you to provide certain information to create your profile, including your name, a username, password, and email address. Providing additional information beyond what is required to create an account, such as providing a photo, your age, gender, birthdate, hobbies and interests is entirely optional, but enables you to gain more from the Talnts Features.  Talnts may collect personal information submitted through online registration and feedback forms, purchase order forms, chat rooms, forums or through communications with Talnts when you receive customer or technical support. We may also collect financial qualification and billing information, such as billing name and address and credit/debit card information. Depending on your choices when using the Talnts Features, we may collect additional personal information.
        </p>
        <p>
        We also offer features of the Site that allow you to link your account to Facebook, Twitter, and/or Instagram. If you sign up for one of these services, we may also collect personally identifiable information from these Internet sources and services.
        </p>
        <p>
        By submitting personal information through the Site, you authorize Talnts to share this personal information for the purposes identified herein and on the Site, such as responding to user inquiries processing transactions, distributing materials, and requesting feedback. When you are purchasing services through the Talnts Features, you will also be required to provide a billing address and credit card or other payment information.  No information of this type will be collected unless you have registered for services that require it.
        </p>
        <h3>Third Party Privacy Policies</h3>
        <p>
        Through the Talnts Features, you may be able to link to technology, software and services owned and controlled by third parties ("Third Party Features"). You may be permitted or required to submit personal information to access Third Party Features. Such use of Third Party Features and submission of information through Third Party Features will be subject to such applicable third party's Terms of Use/Service and Privacy Policy. You agree to look solely to the applicable third party and not to Talnts to enforce your rights in relation thereto. When you have clicked on a third party logo or URL displayed on the App or the Site, or accessible through the Talnts Features, which links you to any Third Party Features, our Terms of Use no longer applies and you must read the Terms of Use/Service and Privacy Policy of the third party to see how your personal information will be handled on their website.
        </p>
        <h3>
            How We Use Your Personal Information
        </h3>
        <p>
        The personal information you provide to us will allow us to provide the Talnts Features to you, including providing you with Internet communication capabilities; verify your identity; alert you of new products or services, features, or enhancements to the Talnts Features; handle your customer service questions or issues; provide for order processing; request feedback; distribute newsletters; and notify you of promotions, contests, surveys updates, or special offers that we think may interest you. We may also use your email address as part of the Talnts Features in sending you messages about the Talnts Features and other general announcements. Additionally, personal information you make public will be viewable by other users of the Site. We keep track of your interactions with us, including but not limited to your activity within the Talnts Features. We may also use your personal information to contact you when necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
        We may use your personal information with non-personal information that we have collected in a manner such that the end-product does not personally identify you or any other user of the Talnts Features. We may make your personal information non-personally identifiable by either combining it with information about other users (aggregating your personal information with information about other users), or by removing characteristics (such as your name or email address) that make the information personally identifiable. This process is known as de-personalizing your information. You grant us a royalty-free, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable and fully transferable right and license to use your personal information in connection with the creation and development of analytical and statistical analysis tools relating to the use of the customer data we collect in providing the Talnts Features (the "Analytical Data"). We are expressly authorized to make any commercial use of the Analytical Data, including without limitation, sharing the Analytical Data with third parties, provided that we do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer from us any part of the Analytical Data that personally identifies any Talnts Features users.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Cookies
        </h3>
        <p>
        "Cookies" are small bits of electronic information that a website sends to a visitor's browser and are stored on the visitor's hard drive. Like many websites, we may employ cookies in certain areas of the Site to allow us to provide information to make your online experience more convenient. For example, when you return to the Site after logging in, cookies provide information to the Site so that the Site will remember who you are on subsequent visits, speeding up or enhancing your experience of the Talnts Features by, for instance, tailoring content to you. While Talnts may use cookies to track your visit to the Site, this information does not identify you personally and you remain anonymous, even if you have previously submitted personal information to Talnts through the Site or otherwise.
        </p>
        <p>
        Third parties whose websites are accessible through links on the Site may also use their own cookies when you link to their site or service. Talnts does not control these third parties' use of cookies and cannot guarantee that they will uphold the same privacy standards as Talnts. Talnts expressly disclaims any and all liability related to the collection, use or disclosure of information by third parties. You should review the privacy policies of any third party sites that you visit through a link from the Site to understand how these third parties use cookies and the information they collect through cookies. Most cookies are "session cookies" which means that they are automatically deleted at the end of each session. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you a chance to decide whether or not to accept it.
