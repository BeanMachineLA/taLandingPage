                Because some states or jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or the limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, in such states or jurisdictions, the liability of Talnts and the Related Parties shall be limited to the fullest extent permitted by law.
            </li>
            <li><span id="listhead">Indemnification.</span> You agree to defend, indemnify and hold Talnts and the Related Parties harmless from and against any and all claims, demands, liabilities damages and losses including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees, resulting from or arising out of (a) your use of the Site, the App and/or the Service; or (b) your breach of this ToU or any other policies that Talnts may issue for the Site, the App and/or the Service from time to time. </li>
            <li><span id="listhead">Governing Law; Jurisdiction.</span> This ToU is governed by California law, without regard to conflict of laws principles. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. You and Talnts agree that, except as otherwise provided in Section 21 below, the state and federal courts located in the County of Los Angeles, California will have exclusive jurisdiction of all disputes arising out of or related to this ToU or your use of the Site or the Service and agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction and venue of these courts. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Talnts shall be allowed to apply for equitable remedies (including injunctions) in any jurisdiction.</li>
            <li><span id="listhead">Binding Arbitration.</span>
                <p>01. <span id="subhead">Arbitration Procedures.</span> You and Talnts agree that, except as provided in Section 21.4 below, all disputes, controversies and claims related to this ToU (each a "Claim"), shall be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration, which may be initiated by either party by sending a written notice requesting arbitration to the other party. Any election to arbitrate by one party shall be final and binding on the other. The arbitration will be conducted under the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures of JAMS that are in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated (the "JAMS Rules") and under the terms set forth in this ToU. In the event of a conflict between the terms set forth in this Section 21 and the JAMS Rules, the terms in this Section 21 will control and prevail.</p>
                <p>Except as otherwise set forth in Section 21.4, you may seek any remedies available to you under federal, state or local laws in an arbitration action. As part of the arbitration, both you and Talnts will have the opportunity for discovery of non-privileged information that is relevant to the Claim. The arbitrator will provide a written statement of the arbitrator's decision regarding the Claim, the award given and the arbitrator's findings and conclusions on which the arbitrator's decision is based. The determination of whether a Claim is subject to arbitration shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and determined by a court rather than an arbitrator. Except as otherwise provided in this ToU, (a) you and Talnts may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator; and (b) the arbitrator's decision shall be final, binding on all parties and enforceable in any court that has jurisdiction, provided that any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to follow applicable law. </p>
                <p>BY AGREEING TO THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION, YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU AND TALNTS WAIVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. </p>
                <br/>
                <p>02. <span id="subhead">Location.</span> The arbitration will take place in Los Angeles, California, unless the parties agree to video, phone and/or internet connection appearances. </p>
                <p>03. <span id="subhead">Limitations.</span> You and Talnts agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Claim between Talnts and you individually. YOU AND TALNTS AGREE THAT (a) THERE IS NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE ARBITRATED ON A CLASS-ACTION BASIS OR TO UTILIZE CLASS ACTION PROCEDURES; (b) THERE IS NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE BROUGHT IN A PURPORTED REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY OR AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL; AND (c) NO ARBITRATION SHALL BE JOINED WITH ANY OTHER ARBITRATION.</p>
                <p>04. <span id="subhead">Exceptions to Arbitration.</span> You and Talnts agree that the following Claims are not subject to the above provisions concerning negotiations and binding arbitration: (a) any Claim seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of Talnts's intellectual property rights; (b) any Claim related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy or unauthorized use; and (c) any claim for equitable relief. In addition to the foregoing, either party may assert an individual action in small claims court for Claims that are within the scope of such court's jurisdiction in lieu of arbitration.</p>
                <p>05. <span id="subhead">Arbitration Fees.</span> If you initiate arbitration for a Claim, you will need to pay the JAMS arbitration initiation fee. If we are initiating arbitration for a Claim, we will pay all costs charged by JAMS for initiating the arbitration. All other fees and costs of the arbitration will be charged pursuant to the JAMS Rules. </p>
                <p>06. <span id="subhead">Severability.</span> You and Talnts agree that if any portion this Section 21 is found illegal or unenforceable (except any portion of Section 21.4), that portion shall be severed and the remainder of the Section shall be given full force and effect. If Section 21.4 is found to be illegal or unenforceable then neither you nor Talnts will elect to arbitrate any Claim falling within that portion of Section 21.4 found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Claim shall be exclusively decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the County of Los Angeles, California, United States of America, and you and Talnts agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.</p>
